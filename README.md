# What a Fancy Page

### Greetings,
This is a fairly fancy-looking document. In fact I'd say that it's smashingly fancy. The entire thing just oozes confidence and competence, the two best qualities to find in a game developer. In fact it's such a fancy page that I feel the absurd need to talk about it for a while, using the page itself. Perhaps I should give more detail? Break down my reasoning?

**Here's a list of the things that this page does excellently.**
+ First off, there's two titles.
+ Secondly, how about that picture right at the bottom?
+ That picture just screams 'excellence'
+ Holy crap, this is a list
+ Everyone knows lists are amazing.

Well, I believe I've said my part. Hopefully you're as convinced as I am of this page's fancy-ness. That's a word now, don't worry about it. This isn't English class.
